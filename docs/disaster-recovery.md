## 5. Recovery Procedures

### 5.1 Immediate Response (0-30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Incident Assessment
1. **Identify the scope of the disaster**
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   ./deploy.sh status
   
   # Check service health
   curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health
   
   # Review system logs
   docker-compose logs --tail=100
   ```

2. **Determine recovery strategy**
   - Partial failure: Component-specific recovery
   - Complete failure: Full system recovery
   - Data corruption: Point-in-time recovery

3. **Activate disaster recovery team**
   - System Administrator (Primary)
   - Database Administrator
   - Network Administrator
   - ICT Support Team

#### Step 2: Communication
1. **Internal Notification**
   ```bash
   # Send alert to admin team
   echo "DISASTER RECOVERY ACTIVATED: $(date)" | \
   mail -s "EMS Disaster Recovery" admin@school.edu
   ```

2. **User Communication**
   - Post maintenance notice on website
   - Send email to all users
   - Update status page

### 5.2 Recovery Execution (30 minutes - 4 hours)

#### Scenario A: Database Failure

1. **Stop all services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Assess database damage**
   ```bash
   # Check database status
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready
   ```

3. **Restore from backup**
   ```bash
   # Find latest backup
   LATEST_BACKUP=$(find /backups -name "evidence-management-system_*" -type d | sort -r | head -n 1)
   
   # Restore database
   docker-compose exec postgres dropdb -U evidence_user evidence_management
   docker-compose exec postgres createdb -U evidence_user evidence_management
   pg_restore -h localhost -p 5432 -U evidence_user -d evidence_management \
             "$LATEST_BACKUP/database/full_backup.dump"
   ```

4. **Verify restoration**
   ```bash
   # Run verification script
   ./scripts/backup-verification.sh "$LATEST_BACKUP"
   ```

5. **Restart services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

#### Scenario B: Complete System Failure

1. **Prepare new environment**
   ```bash
   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/evidence-management-system.git
   cd evidence-management-system
   
   # Restore configuration
   cp /backup/config/.env.production .env.production
   ```

2. **Restore database**
   ```bash
   # Start database service
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   
   # Wait for database to be ready
   sleep 30
   
   # Restore from backup
   LATEST_BACKUP="/backups/evidence-management-system_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS"
   pg_restore -h localhost -p 5432 -U evidence_user -d evidence_management \
             "$LATEST_BACKUP/database/full_backup.dump"
   ```

3. **Restore files**
   ```bash
   # Extract file backup
   tar -xzf "$LATEST_BACKUP/files/uploads.tar.gz" -C ./
   
   # Set proper permissions
   chown -R 1001:1001 uploads/
   ```

4. **Start all services**
   ```bash
   # Deploy application
   ./deploy.sh deploy
   
   # Verify deployment
   ./deploy.sh health
   ```

#### Scenario C: File Storage Failure

1. **Stop application services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose stop app
   ```

2. **Restore file storage**
   ```bash
   # Clear corrupted storage
   rm -rf uploads/*
   
   # Restore from backup
   LATEST_BACKUP="/backups/evidence-management-system_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS"
   tar -xzf "$LATEST_BACKUP/files/uploads.tar.gz" -C ./
   
   # Verify file integrity
   find uploads/ -type f -exec file {} \; | grep -v "ASCII\|UTF-8\|PDF\|image"
   ```

3. **Update file storage configuration**
   ```bash
   # Restart MinIO if using local storage
   docker-compose restart minio
   
   # Verify storage connectivity
   docker-compose exec app npm run storage:test
   ```

4. **Restart application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose start app
   ```
